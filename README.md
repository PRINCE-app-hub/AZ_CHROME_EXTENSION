## 🧠 What I Learned

This project helped me deeply understand how Chrome Extensions work:

### ✅ Skills Gained
- 📦 Setting up a clean extension structure (`manifest.json`, content/background/popup scripts)
- 🔁 Using `chrome.storage.sync` for persistent bookmarking
- 📬 Messaging between background and content scripts
- 🧪 Debugging service workers and extension behavior in Chrome DevTools
- 💡 Building a dynamic and responsive popup UI

### 🚧 Challenges Faced
- Fixing `manifest.json` errors and getting paths right  
- Figuring out why the popup didn’t display or store bookmarks  
- Locating logs in different contexts (popup, content, background)
